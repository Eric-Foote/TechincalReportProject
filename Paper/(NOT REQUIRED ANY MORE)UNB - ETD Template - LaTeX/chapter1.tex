\chapter{Introduction} "The techniques I developed for studying turbulence, like weather, also apply to the stock market''.\cite{Mandlebrot} The common techniques shared between meteorological and financial data is the field known as time series data. Which can be defined as "a sequence of observations measured as successive times.''\cite{TimeSeriesDefinition} In this project I set out to compare different machine learning algorithms applied to Black Berry stock data collected from February 3 1999 to September 27 2021. The first thing I am going to do is outline some background information about all of the different machine learning algorithms applied to the data and explain time series some more. Following that I am going to outline the methods applied and discuss the results.
